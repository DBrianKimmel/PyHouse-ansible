#
# this inventory is for setting up a new raspberry pi.

# Start with a newly flashed SD card with raspbian stretch lite.
# Add the empty file "ssh" in the boot partition - this will allow ssh to work.
# The inital connection will be via ethernet as the wifi setup is not yet working.
#
# Create a host_vars file with the proper information
