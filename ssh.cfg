# Ansible config for a user on the ansible control computer.  This file is named in ansible.cfg in ssh_args.

# If the host to which we are going is not on the local network we must:
#	ssh into a jump host and from there:
#		ssh into the target host.
#
# Are we in Florida(House=1), Franklin (House=2) or remote (House=0)?

# ================================================
# Define some simple aliases so we can ssh to the alias here.
Host pinkpoppy
   HostName  		pinkpoppy.asuscomm.com

Host cannontrail
   HostName  		cannontrail.asuscomm.com


# ================================================
# Now for the networks.
# change the network if we are within that network so we don't try to proxy the local network.
#Host 192.168.1.*
#   User            briank
#   ProxyCommand    ssh -AXC -p 2254 briank@pinkpoppy.asuscomm.com     -W %h:22

Host 192.168.9.*
   User             briank
   ProxyCommand     ssh -p 2281 briank@cannontrail.asuscomm.com   -W %h:22

# ================================================
# Now for some global settings.
