# Ansible config for a user on the ansible control computer.  This file is named in ansible.cfg in ssh_args.
#
# If the host to which we are going is not on the local network we must:
#	ssh into a jump host and from there:
#		ssh into the target host.
#

# ================================================
# Define some simple aliases so we can ssh to the alias here.
Host pinkpoppy
   HostName  pinkpoppy.asuscomm.com
Host cannontrail
   HostName  cannontrail.asuscomm.com


# ================================================
# Now for the networks.
# change the network if we are within that network so we don't try to proxy the local network.
