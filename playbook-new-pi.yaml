#
# This is the top level playbook for new raspberryt6 pi computers.
# It is involed by the ansible-new-pi command
# This playbook is a dispatcher.
#
# Loads other playbooks when calling tags are defined.
#
# Since the default raspbian image has user pi with a well kbown password,
#  this will ssh into that user at first, add the admin user and change the well known password and then
#  switch to a playbook in the playbooks dir to continue as the root installer used by all other playbooks.
