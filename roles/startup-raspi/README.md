Raspi Setup
===========

This playbook role is for the initial setup of a raspberry pi running raspbian-lite.

It assumes you are able to ssh into the pi via ethernet and the default passwords are still in place.
All that is required is to load a new sd card with raspbian-lite and put an empty file named ssh into the boot partition.
