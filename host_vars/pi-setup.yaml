# This is the host_vars file for setting up a raspberry pi for home automation use.

# When each PI boots with ethernet, a new ip is set up = put that IP in below.
# Wifi will not work since it has not been set up to use the house access points yet.
# Only the "pi" user exists at first.

# These must be changed
